This Python script provides functionality to download transcripts from Apple Podcast episodes when available. Key features include:

- Extracts podcast IDs from Apple Podcasts URLs
- Fetches podcast metadata via iTunes API
- Parses RSS feeds to enumerate episodes
- Attempts to download transcripts from episode pages (with placeholder implementation for platform-specific transcript fetching)
- Saves transcripts as text files with episode metadata
- Includes rate limiting and error handling

**Note:** Transcript availability varies by podcast and platform. The current implementation provides a framework that would need customization for specific podcast platforms' transcript APIs.
